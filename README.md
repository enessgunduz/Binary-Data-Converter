# Binary-Data-Converter
This is the project for the assignment of System Programming class.  
The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with bit-level representations of integers and floating point numbers. For more info, check Project-Info.pdf file.

If you are a student, please do not copy-paste the code, try to understand it and do it yourself. You cannot improve your coding skills by copying codes. Also that would be cheating, copy codes are mostly forbidden in schools.
